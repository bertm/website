<p><em>"I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though she's too
 young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 or
 15 years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy, where were you when
 they took freedom of the press away from the Internet?'"</em>
--Mike Godwin, <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and
publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on
forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less
vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to
their friends, is very difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are routed through other
nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is requesting the
information and what its content is.</p>
<p>Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their
hard drive (called the "data store") for storing files. Files are
automatically kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the
least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular content.
Files are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in
his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it. Chat forums,
websites, and search functionality, are all built on top of this distributed
data store.</p>
<p>Freenet has been downloaded over 2 million times since the project started,
and used for the distribution of censored information all over the world
including countries such as China and the Middle East. Ideas and concepts
pioneered in Freenet have had a significant impact in the academic world. Our
2000 paper "Freenet: A Distributed Anonymous Information Storage and
Retrieval System" was the most cited computer science paper of 2000 according
to Citeseer, and Freenet has also inspired papers in the worlds of law and
philosophy. Ian Clarke, Freenet's creator and project coordinator,
was selected as one of the top 100 innovators of 2003 by MIT's Technology
Review magazine.</p>
<p>An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the
"darknet": By only connecting to people they trust, users can greatly reduce
their vulnerability, and yet still connect to a global network through their
friends' friends' friends and so on. This enables people to use Freenet even
in places where Freenet may be illegal, makes it very difficult for
governments to block it, and does not rely on tunneling to the "free world".</p>

</ol><a id="disclaimer"></a><h3>1. A Disclaimer</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why people get involved in the Freenet Project. Some
share the views outlined in this document; some share variations of these views,
which are also served by what we are trying to achieve; and some just enjoy the
technical challenge. These are the ideas which motivated me to architect the
system in the first place, but not necessarily the views that everyone involved
in the Freenet project holds.</p><a id="prior_reading"></a><h3>2. Suggested prior reading</h3>
<p>For this document to make sense, you should probably know what Freenet is. You
can get a good overview from <a href="about.html#introduction">What is Freenet?</a>.</p><a id="free_flow_info"></a><h3>3. The importance of the Free flow of information</h3>
<p>Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally considered to be one
of the most important rights any individual might have. Why is the freedom to
share ideas and opinions so important? There are several ways to answer this
question.</p><h4>3.1 Communication is what makes us human</h4>
<p>One of the most obvious differences between mankind and the rest of the animal
kingdom is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract concepts. While
we constantly discover that animal's communication ability is more sophisticated
than previously assumed, it is unlikely that any other animal approaches our own
level of ability in this area.</p><h4>3.2 Knowledge is good</h4>
<p>Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing something,
will choose to have more information rather than less. Wars have been won and
lost over who was better-informed. This is because being better-informed allows
us to make better decisions, and generally improve our ability to survive and be
successful.</p><h4>3.3 Democracy assumes a well informed population</h4>
<p>Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who don't,
probably want to. Democracy is an answer to the question of how to create
leaders, while preventing them from abusing that power. It achieves this by
giving the population the power to regulate their government through voting,
yet the ability to vote does not necessarily mean that you live in a
democratic country. For a population to regulate their government effectively
it must know what their government is doing, they must be well informed. It
is a feedback loop, but this loop can be broken if the government has the
power to control the information the population has access to.</p><a id="censor_freedom"></a><h3>4. Censorship and freedom</h3>
<p>Everyone values their freedom, in fact, many consider it so important that
they will die for it. People like to think that they are free to form and
hold whatever opinions they like, particularly in western countries. Consider
now that someone had the ability to control the information you have access
to. This would give them the ability to manipulate your opinions by hiding
some facts from you, by presenting you with lies and censoring anything that
contradicted those lies. This is not some Orwellian fiction, it is standard
practice for most western governments to lie to their populations, so much
so, that people now take it for granted, despite the fact that this
undermines the very democratic principles which justify the government's
existence in the first place.</p><a id="solution"></a><h3>5. The solution</h3>
<p>The only way to ensure that a democracy will remain effective is to ensure
that the government cannot control its population's ability to share
information, to communicate. So long as everything we see and hear is
filtered, we are not truly free. Freenet's aim is to allow two or more people
who wish to share information, to do so.</p><a id="is_censorship_necessary"></a><h3>6. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?</h3>
<p>Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that
censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some
European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal.
Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed
damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is that
you can't allow those in power to impose "good" censorship, without also
enabling them to impose "bad" censorship. To impose any form of censorship a
government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict communication.
There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship in many European
countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of events such as the
second world war.</p>
<p>The second argument is that this "good" censorship is counter-productive even
when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally more
effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them with
the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. Unfortunately,
preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated arguments used
by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually
encounter them.</p>
<p>Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true
even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship,
or you don't. There is no middle-ground.</p><a id="why_anonymity"></a><h3>7. But why is anonymity necessary?</h3>
<p>You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.
Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free
speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing
them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to
remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust
anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures
people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can
learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called "subspaces" to
facilitate this.</p><a id="copyright"></a><h3>8. And what of copyright?</h3>
<p>Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of
copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with
copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications,
and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything
you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point
when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of
Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright.</p><a id="reward"></a><h3>9. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?</h3>
<p>Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded
for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than
having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do not
understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion,
the only question is whether they can do it for a living).</p>
<p>Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. The
music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in
communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be
rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed
middle-men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the
detriment of both artists and the public.</p><a id="alternative"></a><h3>10. Alternatives to Copyright</h3>
<p>Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to reward
artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension of the
patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists prior to
copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to allow them to
create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting extension of this idea,
where rather than having just one wealthy patron, you could have hundreds of
thousands, contributing small amounts of money over the Internet.</p>
<p>We actually practice what we preach in this regard too, on the 15th of March
2001 the Freenet Project started taking donations, and within a week we had
collected over $1000.</p>

A proposal for changing the routing algorithm which we are still considering
(the worst case performance i.e. when a block has been lost may be
unacceptable).</p>

A paper describing some attacks on Freenet 0.7's location swapping algorithm.
We have solutions for this but they are still being tested.</p>

<p>The most up to date reference is of course <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred">the source code</a>, but there is also some useful documentation on
<a href="https://wiki.freenetproject.org/">the wiki</a> (you may have to search a bit),
and most implemented ideas have been discussed in detail on <a href="help.html#mailing-lists">the mailing
lists</a> at some point, more recently often in-Freenet
forums such as FMS, or <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/">the bug tracker</a>.</p>
