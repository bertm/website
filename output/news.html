A recent article outlines
<a href="http://web-in-security.blogspot.ca/2015/09/practical-invalid-curve-attacks.html">
practical attacks against elliptic curves</a> to recover private keys
which worked against the Bouncy Castle crypto provider used by Freenet
until <a href="#build01466">Build 1466</a> (released 2014-11-09) and
against Java JCE
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujul2015-2367936.html">
until July 2015</a>. If you use the current stable
<a href="#20150816-1470-release">build 1470</a> on an updated Java, your
node is not vulnerable to these attacks.
</p>

<p>
On darknet the attacks required knowing both node references, so in
darknet mode Freenet was only vulnerable to them if two friends
connected to the same malicious third party or shared their node
references in public. On opennet the target of these attacks would have
been the seednodes because other opennet connections are neither
persistent nor trusted.

This release fixes two bugs introduced in build 1468. One caused very
slow operation and high CPU usage with large files and physical
security levels above None (i.e. Freenet-level disk encryption). The
other prevented interactive usage (e.g. freesite browsing) while
finishing large downloads or starting large uploads.

Despite being in some form of prerelease for over 6 months, and two weeks of
being available as a release candidate, we didn't catch some bugs in time. There
are two main issues:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Because the reimplementation of the client layer without db4o did not include
prioritization of FEC decoding / encoding, large bulk download or upload queues
can starve the realtime queues, making them unresponsive.
(See <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/381">PR #381</a>.)
</li>
<li>
Due to our misunderstanding of when the cryptography library we use - Bouncy
Castle - included which fixes, we did not realize that version 1.51, used by
build 1468, has severe performance problems with the way we use it to implement
disk encryption. Build 1469 will upgrade to Bouncy Castle 1.52, which fixes this
problem. It is only an issue when the physical security level is set to "Low" or
higher. It does not happen when physical security is set to "None."
(See <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/382">PR #382</a>.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sadly, these problems can combine to make a node use 100% CPU to slowly process
bulk queues while the realtime queue does not respond. Matthew (toad_) has
already released a snapshot to fix these problems, which you can find
<a href="https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2015-July/038123.html">on the mailing list</a>
or <a href="http://localhost:8080/forumviewthread.htm?messageuuid=E544C7BB-5E5E-4159-83F8-AFC46C089329@h2RzPS4fEzP0zU43GAfEgxqK2Y55kEUNR01cWvYApI#E544C7BB-5E5E-4159-83F8-AFC46C089329@h2RzPS4fEzP0zU43GAfEgxqK2Y55kEUNR01cWvYApI">on FMS</a>.

        <p>
The Freenet team is very happy to announce the stable release of Freenet 0.7.5 build 1468.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the "node.updater.URI" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.
</p>

<p>
In this release, the way Freenet stores data locally has changed drastically by no longer using the now-deprecated db4o object storage. It is replaced with the product of toad's summer of work - a custom on-disk format that is much more robust against corruption and more efficient.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>
<li>Space for downloads is now all allocated at the start, so machines very low on disk space may run out, which causes downloads to temporarily fail until more space is available.</li>
<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>
<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>
<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>
<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>
<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Windows installer now defaults to starting Freenet on login.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/freenet/wintray">new Windows tray app</a> with some useful features that is included with new installations. If you are using the existing Windows tray app you can download the new one <a href="https://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/installer/FreenetTray.exe.build01468">here</a>. No need to put it in a specific directory - it will try the default installation location and prompt if it can't find it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The list of download keys moved from downloads/listFetchKeys.txt to downloads/listKeys.txt.</li>
<li>A list of upload keys is now available at uploads/listKeys.txt</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Gantros' index is now in the default bookmarks. It uses the same software as Enzo's index, which is no longer updated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The obsolete and deprecated XMLLibrary and XMLSpider plugins are no longer officially supported. They will still load for those who have them added, but are no longer shown on the plugin page.</li>
<li>In the interests of releasing this build more quickly, the new version of FlogHelper does not support exporting and importing backups from the web UI. The old backup code did not work with the new Freenet version after removing db4o. People can instead back up "plugins.floghelper.FlogHelper" files in the plugin-data directory. These can be dropped into the directory after unloading FlogHelper to restore a backup.</li>
<li>ThawIndexBrowser works again. Thanks saces!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fred translations are updated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Add two seed nodes, one sponsored by meshnet.pl - the Polish radio/meshnet darknet users group, and another run by ArneBab. Thanks!</li>
<li>Update existing seed node references.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thank you for using Freenet!

This weekend we will release an updated Windows installer for build 1467 along
with a <a href="https://github.com/freenet/wintray/blob/master/README.md">new Windows tray application</a>.
We will also release 1468-pre4, which if all goes according to plan will be the
last prerelease before a stable release two weeks later.

<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Opinion/Communications/States/Selected_References_SR_Report.pdf">companion pdf</a>).
From the summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>encryption and anonymity enable individuals to exercise their rights to
freedom of opinion and expression in the digital age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reports concludes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>63. The use of encryption and anonymity tools and better digital literacy
should be encouraged. The Special Rapporteur, recognizing that the value
of encryption and anonymity tools depends on their widespread adoption,
encourages States, civil society organizations and corporations to engage
in a campaign to bring encryption by design and default to users around
the world and, where necessary, to ensure that users at risk be provided
the tools to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression securely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We with the Freenet Project welcome the official recognition of our mission
as important part of securing human rights in the digital age and we invite
everyone - especially reporters and civil society organizations - to install
Freenet and its communication tools to provide a point of contact for users at risk.</p>

<p>What is done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the unreliable db4o database. (Yay!)</li>

<li>Update Windows installer translations for Finnish and French.</li>
<li>Add Windows installer translations for Czech, German, Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Simplified Chinese.</li>
<li>Improve the reliability of starting Freenet under changing Java installations on Linux/OS X/POSIX.</li>
<li>Update WebOfTrust with bug fixes and a new API.</li>
</ul>
<p>What remains to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Finish reviewing the synchronous plugin communication API. Review is split between <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/319">GitHub</a> and more recently the <a href="https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2015-February/037986.html">development mailing list</a>.</del> -- Done 2015-03-28</li>
<li>Update all plugins (KeyUtils and WebOfTrust are already ready) for the API breakage in this version.</li>
<li>Add a .NET 3.5 install to the Windows installer, along with the new tray app. (This is necessary for it to always work for those not on Windows 7.)</li>
<li>Everything on <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=85">this list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this is such a large release new installers for build 1467 will be released shortly to test those changes. Once everything on this list is complete, there will be a release candidate, then finally the stable release.</p>

        <p>The Windows tray application distributed as of build 1467 is written in the automation scripting language AutoHotKey. It has not been well-maintained and is also often falsely detected by antivirus by virtue of the language it uses. We are pleased to announce a new Windows tray application written in C# which has some additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow choosing which browser to launch.</li>
<li>Allow starting Freenet without the tray on startup.</li>
<li>Allow opening the Downloads folder from the menu.</li>
<li>Give a more actionable response to crashes.</li>
<li>Can be hidden while keeping Freenet running.</li>
<li>Can be located other places than in the Freenet installation folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes well we plan for this tray app to be distributed with build 1468. Testing is appreciated! If you'd like to try it for yourself you can find it <a href="https://downloads.freenetproject.org/FreenetTray-testing-eaf31ea.exe">here</a>.

        <p>Developers of the privacy-focused Debian derivative Mempo report that it can download updates over Freenet! For details, see their page on <a href="http://deb.mempo.org/#install_apt_freenet">Apt over Freenet</a>.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>use Freenet to distribute online updates</li>
<li>most secure hosting option</li>
</ul>
<p>That means it is now possible to get reproducibly built kernels checked by anonymous (and therefore hard to pressure) contributors and update them over Freenet without disclosing that you use them. This applies to the packages provided by Mempo - other apt-get activity like installing GIMP is still public. It would be possible to host the entire Debian repository in Freenet, but this is not yet on the agenda for Mempo because this other activity does not disclose the potentially sensitive information that you want additional privacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practical cool result now, is that Mempo repository can not be censored, DDoSed or taken offline, despite having just 1 tiny server (or no server at all) - rfreeman (one of the mempo developers)</p>

        <p>This release is planned to be the second-to-last version of Freenet to support Java 6. The version after this one will refuse to upgrade unless running on Java 7 or later. Support for this behavior is part of a larger effort to allow separate official update channels - stable, testing, and unstable - as well as make it easier to publish unofficial update channels and further improve deployment security.</p>
<p>Highlights for this build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)</li>
<li>Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get <a href="https://bugs.freenetproject.org/view.php?id=3208">stuck in an upgrade loop</a>.</li>
<li>Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has <a href="https://github.com/freenet/fred/pull/286">more math behind it</a> and will change when network parameters are adjusted.</li>
<li>Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!</li>
<li>This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally Matthew's (toad_'s) summer work on a custom on-disk format is done. This release lays the groundwork to include the results of that work <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/USK@pxtehd-TmfJwyNUAW2Clk4pwv7Nshyg21NNfXcqzFv4,LTjcTWqvsq3ju6pMGe9Cqb3scvQgECG81hRdgj5WO4s,AQACAAE/blog/23/Content-626611C.html">in the next release</a>. This is designed for less disk activity and better behavior when corrupted.</p>
<p>This release coincides with the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the Berlin wall (Mauerfall), which marked the beginning of the end of a large censorship and surveillance regime. May censorship be demolished everywhere!</p>
<p>Thank you for using Freenet!</p>

        <p>According to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/">the press</a>, half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.</p>
<p>This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting">Tor blog</a> and <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html">mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see <a href="https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor">our explanation in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major "darknets" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.</p>
<p>Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend "darknet". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.</p>
<p>We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.</p>
<p>Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!</p>

        <p>Long time coder xor (also known as p0s) has agreed to work, in a paid role, for us on fixing the Web of Trust plugin. This is a crucial component of many Freenet plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sone</strong>, an anonymous social network / microblogging tool.</li>
<li><strong>Freemail</strong>, a private and untraceable email over Freenet system.</li>
<li>A filesharing system as yet unnamed which a student is working on.</li>
<li>Extensions to Infocalypse, being worked on by another student, a tool for managing source code which is vital to developing software over Freenet.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Freenet Social Networking Guide for how to load the first 2 plugins.</p>
<p>xor is well qualified for the role as he wrote most of the current code in the Web of Trust. The immediate priority will be to improve stability and performance by implementing a new more efficient FCP API. After that further optimisations are planned.</p>
<p>Freenet relies on unpaid volunteer developers as well as a few key paid developers. Toad (Matthew Toseland) is returning to full time work for Freenet after a study break, although he is off to university in October, and xor is just starting working for Freenet.</p>
<p>Improving the Web of Trust should substantially improve the performance of the key tools mentioned above and may be used by more in the future. Thanks to all our developers and donors!</p>

        <p>Some academics <a href="http://www.ee.hawaii.edu/~dong/traceback/index.htm">have published</a> a couple of attacks against Freenet, and they appear to be working on more as part of a project to unmask anonymous Freenet users. Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the <a href="https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack">other known attacks</a>. You can learn more about the attacks and our solution to them on our chief developer's <a href="http://amphibian.dyndns.org/flogmirror/#20120911-security">personal blog</a>.</p>
<p>We welcome all work to understand Freenet's security and expose any problems with it, although we would suggest that next time they might let us know before they make the paper public, as is common practice in the security community.</p>
<p>Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack.</p>
